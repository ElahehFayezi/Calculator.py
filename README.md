# Python Calculator with PyQt5

A simple yet powerful calculator application built using Python and PyQt5, featuring a visually appealing user interface, responsive layout, and essential arithmetic operations. This project is perfect for beginners looking to enhance their GUI programming skills or for developers interested in building practical desktop applications.

## 📋 Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Responsive UI:** Custom-styled buttons and input fields for a modern user experience.
- **Clear and Backspace Functions:** Easily correct mistakes with dedicated buttons.
- **Real-time Expression Display:** Instant feedback while typing expressions.
- **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of invalid expressions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.9+
- PyQt5 (`pip install PyQt5`)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**

## 📚 Code Highlights

* **Digit Button Generation:**

```python
positions = [(i, j) for i in range(3) for j in range(3)]
for pos, num in zip(positions, range(1, 10)):
    btn = QtWidgets.QPushButton(self.centralwidget)
    btn.setGeometry(QtCore.QRect(20 + pos[1]*110, 90 + pos[0]*70, 93, 61))
    btn.setText(str(num))
```

* **Safe Expression Evaluation:**

```python
def calculate(self):
    try:
        result = str(eval(self.current_expr))
    except Exception:
        result = 'Error'
    self.txtcalc.setText(result)
    self.current_expr = result if result != 'Error' else ''
```
